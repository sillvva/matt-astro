## How It All Started

At the time, I was working for a company called Valmont Industries. I was learning Angular and using that to develop what would become [Valley 365](https://www.valley365.com). I wasn't really enjoying Angular very much. It was clunky and complicated to learn.

I decided to give React a try after hearing about it from the same [Udemy course instructor](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/) via their YouTube channel. I actually enjoyed learning and using React and decided to take the time to build a full fledge web app.

## Why Did I Build a Website?

Before I built my [first personal website](https://mattdekok.herokuapp.com), it took me a while to decide on what my first React project would be. Eventually, I decided to build a personal website that could act as a resume of sorts.

I used the knowledge I learned to not only build a website, but also a [react-styled-flexgrid](https://github.com/sillvva/react-styled-flexgrid) component that could be used to implement a Boostrap-like grid system. Later I took it a step further and expanded the component into a combined CSS Flexbox / Grid container component that makes uses of the same system's media query breakpoints.

## Learning Vue

After learning React and building my website as a practice project, I decided to learn another similar framework for web development called Vue. I took another course for Nuxt, a framework built on Vue, by the same instructor on Udemy.

My first project with Nuxt was a Discord bot and website called RPG Schedule - a bot and web dashboard for scheduling games on Discord. Due to an API change on Discord and a lack of support, the website has since shut down. The bot and website code is still available [on Github](/projects).

## New Website

After some time, I had the desire to rebuild my existing website using Nuxt &mdash; partly to practice more and partly because I wanted to redesign the site. As part of the rebuild, I developed a hexagon menu component that is available [here](/projects).
