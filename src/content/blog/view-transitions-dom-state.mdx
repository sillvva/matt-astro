The most common use case for view transitions is to animate the transition between two pages. However, it is also possible to animate the transition between two DOM states on the same page.

In order for view transitions between two elements to work, they must share a `view-transition-name` property in CSS. However, if two rendered elements have the same view-transition-name at the same time, ViewTransition.ready will reject and the transition will be skipped. [[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-transition-name)] To get the transition to work, you must ensure only one of those elements is rendered at a time. Then you can use `document.startViewTransition` to transition between two DOM states.

## Example

<Example />

```html
<script>
	function startTransition() {
		document.startViewTransition(() => {
			const box1 = document.getElementById("box1");
			const box2 = document.getElementById("box2");
			if (box1.classList.contains("hidden")) {
				box1.classList.remove("hidden");
				box2.classList.add("hidden");
			} else {
				box2.classList.remove("hidden");
				box1.classList.add("hidden");
			}
		});
	}
</script>

<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
	<div>
		<button class="btn btn-primary capitalize" onclick="startTransition()">Run Transition</button>
	</div>
	<div class="relative h-40">
		<div id="box1" class="box absolute left-0 h-40 w-40 bg-red-500"></div>
		<div id="box2" class="box absolute right-0 hidden h-40 w-40 bg-blue-500"></div>
	</div>
</div>

<style>
	.box {
		view-transition-name: box;
	}
</style>
```
